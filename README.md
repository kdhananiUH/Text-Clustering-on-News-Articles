# Text Clustering of News Articles 8-)

+ In this project, we have clustered the news articles 
or blog posts from Daily Kos dataset. We have 
used agglomerative clustering (a type of 
hierarchical clustering) and K-means clustering is 
used to cluster the data. 

+ We have analyzed the 
word frequency and top words to answer the 
related questions. Our analysis has provided 
insights into the topics such as, Iraq war and 
Democratic party. 

+ Our findings can be used to 
group similar articles together and assist readers 
in selecting articles of interest.
